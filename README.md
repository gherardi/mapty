## Mapty

### Overview
Mapty is a project designed to enhance my JavaScript skills. This application allows users to display a map on which they can create pins to mark specific locations. Each pin can have details such as the type of activity, distance, duration, and cadence. Mapty combines the power of geolocation and data visualization to create a useful tool for tracking activities.
